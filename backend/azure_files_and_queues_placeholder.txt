This file is a placeholder note:

- Azure Files and Azure Tables/Queues discovery is not yet implemented in code.
- Implementing full support requires adding new Azure SDK dependencies:
  - azure-storage-file-share
  - azure-data-tables
  - azure-storage-queue
- Due to environment/package constraints, these are not wired up automatically here.

Design (for future implementation):
- Use the same credentials as the Azure Blob connector (account name/key or connection string).
- For Azure Files:
  - Use ShareServiceClient to list shares and files.
  - Create assets of type "Azure File" with share as catalog.
- For Tables:
  - Use TableServiceClient to list tables.
  - Create assets of type "Azure Table".
- For Queues:
  - Use QueueServiceClient to list queues.
  - Create assets of type "Azure Queue".

Current state:
- Blob Storage + ADLS Gen2 containers and blobs are discovered via existing azure_blob.py.
- Azure Files and Tables/Queues are not yet discovered.
